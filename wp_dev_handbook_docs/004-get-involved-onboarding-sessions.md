In order to make onboarding easier for new contributors, we recorded onboarding sessions for various parts of the documentation. Some parts of WordPress.org have changed since we recorded sessions, and you might see different things in the video than what’s on the site today. For that reason, we included textual content with updated information along the video, so make sure to read that as well.

**Summary of the External Linking Policy:**

1.  All links, except those on the whitelist, are prohibited.
2.  No new links shall be added at this time for all documentation.
3.  The plug-in handbook is being used as the policy testbed; the rules will eventually apply to all documentation.
4.  For sites that are on the the pre-allowed list that need to be reviewed, the linked sites/blogs can be commercial in nature but the content page linked cannot be used for selling/promoting a product or service.
5.  No plugins/themes/services/hosting etc. will be promoted or recommended. In HelpHub/DevHub, we document only what’s in Core or will be in Core.

    “This is in accordance with HelpHub’s (end user documentation) practice that no plugin, theme, hosting etc will not be promoted or recommended. In HelpHub we are documenting only what’s in core or will be in core.”

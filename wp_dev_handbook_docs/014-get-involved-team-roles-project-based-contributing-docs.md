[The Documentation team handbook](#docs-handbook)
-------------------------------------------------

Project URL: https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/  
Project issues label: `contributor documentation`  
Project issues URL: [contributor documentation](https://github.com/WordPress/Documentation-Issue-Tracker/labels/contributor%20documentation)

**Responsibilities**

*   Work on Docs team handbook issues in the [Issue Tracker repo](https://github.com/WordPress/Documentation-Issue-Tracker/issues/), whether it’s creating a new page or just fixing a part of an existing one.
*   Report on progress at the Documentation team meetings – Project updates agenda item.

**How do I do this job?**

*   Look for [issues labeled with `contributor documentation` label](https://github.com/WordPress/Documentation-Issue-Tracker/labels/contributor%20documentation).
*   Communicate with [the Documentation team handbook project reps](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/the-team/) for any clarifications on the tasks and review of your work. All questions can be asked in the actual GitHub issue, by pinging any of the project reps.
*   Updating the page in the handbook is usually done by one of the project reps or active contributors who have access to the dashboard where the Documentation team’s handbook documentation lives. Consistent contribution over time allows project reps to get to know you and gain trust in you, which can result in giving you access to the dashboard for updating the pages after the review is completed and content approved.
*   Report on your progress at the Documentation team meetings – Project updates agenda item.

[Onboarding coordinator](#onboarding-coordinator)
-------------------------------------------------

Onboarding process can last anywhere between 7 days and 4 weeks, depending on contributor’s prior knowledge, skills, and experience. During this period potential new contributor should learn about documentation projects, team members and other contributors, and all the ways in which they can contribute to the Documentation team. It is not mandatory to attend Documentation team meetings (time zones can be difficult) but it is advisable, for all members of course.

During onboarding period new contributor can start contributing by facilitating the meeting or writing meeting notes. These are great ways to meet the team and get familiarised with all the projects and current priorities. If desired, new contributor can start contributing with other tasks as well.

**Responsibilities**

*   Welcoming new people in #docs Slack channel.
*   Introducing all Documentation projects to new contributors and helping them find tasks that match their interest and skills.
*   Enabling new contributors to independently contribute to any documentation project after the onboarding period – in a way to know where to look for information and who to talk to in order to learn more.

**How do I do this job?**

*   Familiarise yourself with all documentation projects and their representatives – basically what we have in onboarding videos.
*   Greet all new members in #docs Slack channel and offer help with onborading.
*   Communicate regularly with contributors who expressed wish to contribute – at least once a week checking up on them and replying to all their questions meanwhile.
*   Mention members going through onboarding process at the Documentation team meetings – Project updates agenda item.
*   After onboarding period is completed, officially welcome new contributors at the Documentation team meetings – Project updates agenda item.

**Recommended onboarding sessions**

*   [Overview](https://wordpress.tv/2022/06/21/milana-cap-overview-onboarding-for-wordpress-documentation-team/)
*   [Contributor documentation – Documentation team handbook](https://wordpress.tv/2022/06/21/milana-cap-contributor-documentation-documentation-team-handbook-onboarding-for-wordpress-documentation-tea/)

[Contributor Day facilitator](#contributor-day-facilitator)
-----------------------------------------------------------

[Contributor Days](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/contributor-day/contributor-days/) are usually organised as a part of [WordCamp](https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/) but can be standalone events as well.

**It is NOT expected from Docs team Contributor Day Facilitator to organise the event.** Docs team Contributor Day Facilitator is a person who represents the Documentation team at such event, organised by other people. In following description I will be using “table lead” term as it is more commonly used in WordCamp and Contributor Day vocabulary.

**Responsibilities**

*   Presenting documentation tasks for the day, either to all attendees or just to the group of people who registered for the Documentation team (this depends on how organisers of the event want to start the day).
*   Basic onboarding for first timers – it is not unusual that people without wordpress.org accounts attend Contributor Days, for some it’s their first contact with open source community. Basic onboarding covers creating wordpress.org, WordPress Slack and GitHub accounts.
*   Collect all wordpress.org usernames so that Documentation contributor badges can be added to their profiles.
*   Helping out contributors at the table and answering their questions, or directing them to a person who can answer the questions.
*   Gathering info about completed work during the day and presenting it at the end of the day (if organisers have this planned).
*   Reporting on progress made and new contributors at the following Documentation team meeting.

**How do I do this job?**

*   If you are attending a WordCamp check with organisers if there will be Contributor Day (this is usually announced somewhere on the website) and if they already have someone to lead the Documentation team table – it is not unusual to have more than one lead so you can offer to help out if they do.
*   Once you know you’ll be leading the Documentation team table at Contributor Day, check with the Documentation team what could be good tasks for the day. This is best done at the Documentation team meetings – Open floor agenda item, but can be done anytime in [#docs](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/docs/) Slack channel if needed. You can also ping [one of the team reps](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/the-team/) to help you out with this.
*   Contributor Day organisers will communicate with you about the schedule for the day and if you should prepare something – usually that’s just list of tasks from previous item.
*   At the beginning of the day organisers will introduce all teams and their table leads. They might present the tasks for each team or they will invite table leads to do that for their team.
*   Do not hesitate to bring the cookies to bribe contributors. This is, of course, a joke. However… it’s been tested and proven to attract undecided contributors and to have a certain impact in making the day more enjoyable and fun.
*   Help new contributors register all the necessary accounts (wordpress.org, WordPress Slack, and GitHub) and explain them the tasks they might work on. Explain the tasks to more experienced contributors.
*   Invite all contributors to join #docs Slack channel and communicate there anything regarding tasks they are working on.
*   Collect all the wordpress.org usernames so that we can give them contributor badges later.
*   Help contributors with any questions they might have. If you don’t know the answer, ask in Slack channel and someone will answer it.
*   At the end of the day present the progress being done during the day (organisers will invite all table leads to do so in closing remarks). This doesn’t need to be detailed, just some interesting statistics: number of new and total contributors, number of issues it’s been worked on, number of closed issues, how this progress is helpful for WordPress documentation in general etc
*   Present this same statistics at the following Documentation team meeting – Project updates agenda item.

**Contributor Day goal**

In general, Contributor Days are used for tasks that are, at the moment, higher priority for the team but also doable during the day so that all contributors can have a sense of accomplishment.

Some contributors just want to try out contributing to documentation, some want to keep contributing in the future and some contribute only during Contributor Days. Whichever the case, Contributor Day should be a pleasant experience where everyone feels welcome, enjoy the tasks and learning experience and, hopefully, decide to keep contributing in the future as well. It is table lead’s job to create such atmosphere.

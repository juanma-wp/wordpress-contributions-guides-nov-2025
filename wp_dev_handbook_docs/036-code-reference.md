Note: This project was completed. Thank you for your contribution.

As part of the official [documentation roadmap](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/2013/06/19/docs-sprint-results-and-roadmap/) devised by the Docs team in Cincinnati in 2013, much of the work the Docs team is doing of late centers around migrating useful content from the Codex to official handbooks or to the [developer hub](https://developer.wordpress.org/), with the ultimate goal being to eventually shut down the Codex.

Now, all Functions, Hooks, Filters and Classes have inline-docs in the header part and they are automatically converted to [Code Reference](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/), but some of them are missing detail information described in Codex. This project complement it and redirect Codex page to Code Reference.

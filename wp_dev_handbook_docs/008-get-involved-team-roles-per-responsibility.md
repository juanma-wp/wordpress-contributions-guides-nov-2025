Roles per responsibility:

*   [Team reps](#team-reps) (representatives)
*   [Project reps](#project-reps) (representatives)
*   [Contributors](#contributors)

[Contributors](#contributors)
-----------------------------

Contributor is everyone who has ever contributed to the Documentation team by:

*   [Reporting an issue](https://github.com/WordPress/Documentation-Issue-Tracker/issues) with any part or project maintained by the Documentation team.
*   Fixing, in part or whole, [an issue](https://github.com/WordPress/Documentation-Issue-Tracker/issues) with any part or project maintained by the Documentation team.
*   Submitting a code example to [Code reference handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/).
*   Performing any of the [non-project-based roles](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/get-involved/team-roles/non-project-roles/).
*   Attending the [team meeting](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4WU5) and participating in discussions.
*   Attending Contributor Day at the Documentation team table.

To get the most out of contributions, get recognition for contributions and help the team as much as possible, contributors working on projects are advised to closely collaborate with representative for the project. This is the best way to avoid working on something that is not priority or maybe won’t even be used in documentation.

All contributors have earned their Contributor badges by performing these contributions. Badges are manually added so if you have contributed to the Documentation team but don’t have one, please contact [one of the team reps](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/the-team/). Read more about the [Documentation team profile badges](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/get-involved/documentation-team-profile-badge/).

[Project reps](#project-reps)
-----------------------------

A Project rep is a person who takes responsibility for the Documentation team’s projects, in parts or in whole.

This means that this person is a go-to person for all new contributors on the project. Also, a rep is monitoring progress of the project, or its parts, and reports on it during team meetings.

One person can be rep for one or more projects but also can be rep for one project and contributor for others. There is no limit to the number of reps per project. The more people take responsibility, the less pressure on one person there is.

Representative is a team member; one performing the role has both Documentation badges, contributor and team.

Anyone who is interested in becoming a rep can ask the appropriate [rep for the project](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/the-team/) to be included or ask directly [one of the team reps](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/the-team/) in [Slack](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/docs/).

**How do I do this job?**

*   Monitor [GitHub issues](https://github.com/WordPress/Documentation-Issue-Tracker/issues) for their project or projects. Label them when applicable.

*   Review work of other contributors and guide them how to improve it if necessary.
*   Update documentation in their project once the work inissues is completed; or guide other contributors in updating the docs.

[Team reps](#team-reps)
-----------------------

> Team Rep is a leadership role that is mostly administrative in nature; it is not a Lead role. Letting go of the Team Rep title is not a loss of status, just a handing off of responsibilities. Someone who is a leader in a team can lead whether they are doing the team rep job or not. \[…\] The primary Team Rep is responsible for posting a weekly update of the team’s activity to the make.wordpress.org/updates blog, as well as raising any issues or red flags that other teams should be aware of or discussing.

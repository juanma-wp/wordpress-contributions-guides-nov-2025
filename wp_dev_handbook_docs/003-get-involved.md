There are many ways in which it is possible to contribute to Documentation team. To help you decide where to start looking, we’ll present here possibilities based on your skillset.

First make sure you have [access to Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/) and then go to [#docs](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/C02RP4WU5) channel.  

[End User](#end-user)
---------------------

### [Who is end user?](#who-is-end-user)

End user is someone who uses WordPress mainly to create content (publish posts and pages) and modify the way website looks and behaves through admin screens, Dashboard, using themes, plugins and site options.  

### [What can I do?](#what-can-i-do)

Depending on your experience and language skills (native English speaker or not), you can help with documentation for end users:

*   Following guidance in articles and checking if advices are in fact helpful.
*   Proofreading existing pages – making sure that content and screenshots are up to date and links are not broken etc.
*   Writing missing pages if there’s a need.

### [I want to do this. Now what?](#i-want-to-do-this-now-what)

End user documentation is project named [HelpHub](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/helphub/). Refer [Editing Articles](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/helphub/migrating-articles/) for detailed steps.

[Designer](#designer)
---------------------

End user documentation, AKA [HelpHub](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/helphub/), is still in development phase and your input as a designer would be very valuable.  

### [What can I do?](#what-can-i-do-2)

Development of HelpHub is maintained through [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Kenshino/HelpHub/). You can go through the [existing issues](https://github.com/Kenshino/HelpHub/issues) and offer your opinions and suggestions, or you can create new issues for anything you think needs fixing on [staging](https://wp-helphub.com/) or [production](https://wordpress.org/support/) sites.  

### [I want to do this. Now what?](#i-want-to-do-this-now-what-2)

For contributing to HelpHub design you should contact **Mark Uraine** ([@mapk](https://profiles.wordpress.org/mapk)). Ping [@mapk](https://profiles.wordpress.org/mapk) in Slack or send him Direct Message and you’ll get further directions and all the help to get started.

[Developer](#developer)
-----------------------

As a developer you can help in several Documentation team projects. This is also a great opportunity for you to learn and grow as a developer. Regardless of the level of your experience and understanding of WordPress structure and functionality, you’ll find a lot of interesting things to do with Documentation team.

### [Themes and Plugins](#themes-and-plugins)

If you enjoy developing WordPress themes and plugins you can help with:

*   [HelpHub development](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/helphub/helphub-development/)
*   [Theme Developer Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/devhub/)
*   [Plugin Developer Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/devhub/)
*   [Reviewing Code Reference code examples](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/code-reference/editing-articles/reviewing/)

### [Javascript](#javascript)

Even though there’s still no code reference for Javascript, a huge effort has been put in writing inline documentation for it. There are just a few people working on this and we’re always looking for new contributors to help them out.

For getting involved with Javascript inline documentation contact **Anton Timmermans** ([@atimmer](https://profiles.wordpress.org/atimmer)). Dedicated channel for inline documentation is [#core-docs](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/C680YMW9H).

[End user documentation](https://wordpress.org/support/article/wordpress-editor/) is led by Femy Praseeth @femkreations and [developer documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/) is (vacant for now) in [#docs](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4WU5) channels.

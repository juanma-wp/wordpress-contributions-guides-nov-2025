All questions can be asked in the [#docs](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RP4WU5) or [#core-docs](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C680YMW9H) Slack channels, by pinging any of the other curators.
*   Updating the notes in the handbook is usually done by one of the project reps or active contributors who have access to the dashboard where Code reference comments live. Consistent contribution over time allows project reps to get to know you and gain trust in you, which can result in giving you access to the dashboard for monitoring and updating the comments
*   Report on your progress at the Documentation team meetings – Project updates agenda item.
*   A lot of examples of `User contributed notes` can be found on the [WP\_Query class page](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_query/#user-contributed-notes).

**Guidelines**

*   Code should strictly follow [WordPress coding standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/), and any output should be escaped and internationalised.
*   Any feedback about the documentation itself should not be published – these are processed as Trac tickets for the core team (e.g. https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/56324)
*   Prefix all class and function names with `wpdocs_`
*   No support requests: immediately trashed
*   General “thank you” messages should not be published
*   The ultimate goal is for comments to be valuable, easy to read and follow best practices and coding standards. Code examples should work by copying and pasting, and if necessary, changing some things (e.g. taxonomy name, custom post type name etc.).

**Possible workflows:**

*   A user submitted a note reporting an issue with a DocBlock parameter:
    *   Open a ticket on Trac ([example](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/56324))
    *   Mention the commenter’s WordPress username so they can get Core Props for the contribution
    *   Trash the comment once the ticket is committed
*   A user submitted a note with a code example:
    *   Check the formatting, escaping, internationalisation and prefixes.
    *   Check if the code is working as expected (testing it in your local WordPress installation may be the best option).
    *   If everything is correct, publish the comment. If issues are small (from the first item) fix them yourself. If the code is not working or even causing errors, try to contact the author (via slack) to fix the issues. If it is not possible to contact the author (e.g. they don’t have a slack account) and you’re not in a position to fix errors, ask other curators for help and leave a comment as pending. If no progress is made and the author hasn’t contacted the team, trash the comment.
    *   Inform the Documentation team of the username so that contributor can get their Docs badge.

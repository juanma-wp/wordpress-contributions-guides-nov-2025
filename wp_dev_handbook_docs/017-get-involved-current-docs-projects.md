[Past Projects:](#past-projects)
--------------------------------

### [Common APIs Handbook](#common-apis-handbook)

[Common APIs Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/) serves as a clearinghouse for documentation on all APIs present within the WordPress software as well as APIs available from the WordPress.org ecosystem.

For detail steps, refer [https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/documentation-team-handbook/common-apis-handbook/](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/documentation-team-handbook/common-apis-handbook/)

### [HelpHub block editor (Gutenberg) document modification](#helphub-block-editor-gutenberg-document-modification)

WordPress Version 5.0 introduced the Block Editor (code name: Gutenberg), and we need new pages for block editor based on existing page that assumes classic editor.

For detail steps, refer [https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/helphub/migrating-articles/#gutenberg-document-modification](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/helphub/migrating-articles/#gutenberg-document-modification)

### [HelpHub](#helphub)

All end-user related content on the Codex has been migrated to the new HelpHub. ([https://wordpress.org/support](https://wordpress.org/support)) HelpHub is currently in the development phase and is going to be the ultimate home for all user documentation as well as the support forums.

Please refer [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PeHj7pSFLcdMbIC41JJdzEkl12TJT3mwWyzQv2mi01U/edit#gid=554277336) to track status of HelpHub content tasks.

#### [HelpHub migration (done)](#helphub-migration-done)

Docs team picked up Codex pages based on the number of views and migrated to HelpHub:

*   105 Phase-1 pages
*   351 Version pages
*   54 Phase-2 pages

#### [HelpHub redirection](#helphub-redirection)

We need show the warning text at the top of Codex page so that it can tell to visitor that this page was transferred to HelpHub. (e.g. Refer [this page](https://codex.wordpress.org/Contributing_to_WordPress))

For detail steps, refer [](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/helphub/migrating-articles/#transferring-codex-page-to-helphub)[https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/helphub/migrating-articles/#transferring-codex-page-to-helphub](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/helphub/migrating-articles/#transferring-codex-page-to-helphub)

These are earlier projects that have been done by the Documentation team. These are currently considered finished and are located here for historical reasons only.

### [Inline Documentation](#inline-documentation)

**» [Project Page](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/core/inline-docs/)**

Inline documentation for WordPress core is an ongoing project of more technically-minded docs contributors. Work centres primarily on improving the completeness and accuracy of existing code documentation in the WordPress source code, as well as adding new docs.

Work is also being done to bring legacy inline docs into alignment with the official [PHP Documentation Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/inline-documentation-standards/php/).

#### [Codex Migration](#codex-migration)

**» [Project Page](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/code-reference/)**

Content from the function references in the Codex is being migrated from the Codex to the [Code Reference](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/) on the new Developer Hub. As of Spring 2016, most of the examples have been migrated as comments. The remaining reference content and examples were migrated during Dec. 2019 ~ Feb. 2021.

### [Admin help pages](#admin-help-pages)

The admin help in WordPress is the help in the admin panel. The Docs team will sometimes help with updating this documentation. There is currently an effort to create a plugin that will improve the admin help experience.

### [Developer Handbooks](#developer-handbooks)

**» [Project Page](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/developer-resources/handbooks/)**

For the last couple of years, members of the docs team have been working on developer handbooks that largely serve to curate useful information from the Codex and supplement with new, accurate, vetted information simultaneously.

In 2014, v1.0 of the Plugin Developer Handbook was published on the new Developer Hub. In 2016, a beta form of the REST API Handbook was released. Work continues on finishing v1.0 of the Theme Developer Handbook.

### [Content Migration from Codex to DevHub (Code Reference)](#content-migration-from-codex-to-devhub-code-reference)

All Functions, Hooks, Filters and Classes have inline documentations in the header parts and they are automatically converted to [Code Reference](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/). But some of them dropped detail information described in Codex during its migration. This project complement it and redirect Codex page to Code Reference.

The [Documentation issue tracker](https://github.com/WordPress/Documentation-Issue-Tracker) is the central place for contributing to WordPress documentation. No actual documentation is hosted in this repository. Its purpose is to track all the issues for any part of WordPress documentation.

We don’t have Pull Requests there because no actual documentation is hosted in the repository, so we can’t use some other GitHub features, such as “Request review” etc. Also, due to permissions, contributors can’t assign themselves or move issues through our project boards.

Please follow below workflow:

1.  You browse issues and find what you like. Post in comment that you’d like to work on it and start working.
2.  Someone will assign you and move issue into “In progress” column.
3.  When your work is ready for review, post another comment mentioning @zzap , @atachibana or someone else if you were discussing it with someone else.
4.  Someone will move issue to “Review” column. After review you’ll be either asked to fix something or if you’d like to update documentation yourself.
5.  When documentation is updated the issue is moved to “Done” column.

If you have any issues, please report it in [#docs](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/docs/) Slack channel.

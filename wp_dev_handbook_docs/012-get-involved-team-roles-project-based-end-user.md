End-user documentation roles:

*   [General documentation](#general)
*   [Block editor documentation](#block-editor)
*   [Feedback curator](#feedback-curator)

[General end-user documentation](#general)
------------------------------------------

**Project code name**: HelpHub  
**Project URL**: [https://wordpress.org/documentation/](https://wordpress.org/support/)  
**Project GitHub issues label**: `user documentation`  
**Project GitHub issues URL**: [user documentation](https://github.com/WordPress/Documentation-Issue-Tracker/labels/user%20documentation)

**Responsibilities**

*   Work on end-user documentation issues in the [Issue Tracker repo](https://github.com/WordPress/Documentation-Issue-Tracker/issues/), whether it’s creating a new page or just fixing a part of an existing one.
*   Report on progress at the Documentation team meetings – Project updates agenda item.

**How do I do this job?**

*   Look for [issues labelled with `user documentation` label](https://github.com/WordPress/Documentation-Issue-Tracker/labels/user%20documentation).
*   Communicate with [General end-user](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/the-team/) docs project reps for any clarifications on the tasks and review of your work. All questions can be asked in the actual GitHub issue, by pinging any of the project reps.
*   Updating the documentation page/article is usually done by one of the project reps or active contributors who have access to the dashboard where end-user documentation lives. Consistent contribution over time allows project reps to get to know you and gain trust in you, which can result in giving you access to the dashboard for updating the pages after the review is completed and content approved.
*   Report on your progress at the Documentation team meetings – Project updates agenda item.

[Feedback curator](#feedback-curator)
-------------------------------------

**Project code name**: HelpHub  
**Project URL**: [https://wordpress.org/documentation/wp-admin/edit-comments.php](https://wordpress.org/documentation/wp-admin/edit-comments.php)  
**Project GitHub issues labels**: user documentation, block editor  
**Project GitHub issues URL**: [user documentation](https://github.com/WordPress/Documentation-Issue-Tracker/labels/user%20documentation), [block editor](https://github.com/WordPress/Documentation-Issue-Tracker/labels/block%20editor), [any of the version labels](https://github.com/WordPress/Documentation-Issue-Tracker/labels)

**Responsibilities**

*   Regularly check on new Feedback (comments) being submitted to [End user documentation](https://wordpress.org/support/), triage and create issues for them at the [Issue Tracker repo](https://github.com/WordPress/Documentation-Issue-Tracker/issues/).
*   Report on progress at the Documentation team meetings – Project updates agenda item.

**How do I do this job?**

*   Regularly check new feedback/comments at end-user documentation.
*   Delete spam and unrelated comments – anything that is not feedback on the actual article (good or bad).
*   Create an issue in the [Issue Tracker repo](https://github.com/WordPress/Documentation-Issue-Tracker/issues/). Use the `HelpHub Feedback reports` [template](https://github.com/WordPress/Documentation-Issue-Tracker/issues/new?assignees=&labels=HelpHub+feedback&template=helphub-feedback-reports.md&title=%5BHelpHub%5D+Feedback+on).
*   The issue is automatically labelled with the `HelpHub feedback` label. Add `user documentation` label is applicable (At this moment, in April 2023, we still have content that will be redirected to Advanced Administration Handbook. For such content, the label should be advanced administration). If applicable add a `block editor` and any of the [version labels](https://github.com/WordPress/Documentation-Issue-Tracker/labels). Labelling issues is important because some of the labels will send issues to appropriate GitHub projects via GitHub workflows.
*   Report on your progress at the Documentation team meetings – Project updates agenda item.

Members of the WordPress Core team have built and maintained many different plugins throughout the project’s history. When the purpose of the plugin expires, or the functionality is merged into Core, the plugins are closed to help avoid any confusion.

[Feature Plugins](#feature-plugins)
-----------------------------------

Below is a list of feature plugins previously found on the WordPress.org Plugin Directory that have been closed and archived.

**Note:** Not all feature plugins end up listed in the Plugin Directory. A comprehensive list of [feature projects is documented separately](https://make.wordpress.org/core/features/).

The plugins below are feature plugins that were:

*   Merged into Core itself making them unnecessary.
*   Discontinued or abandoned because it became clear that the feature was not a good fit.

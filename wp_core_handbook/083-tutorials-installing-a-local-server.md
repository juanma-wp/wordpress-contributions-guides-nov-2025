This section of the handbook contains tutorials that will walk you through the process of installing one of the four local server programs listed below.

[Why do I need a local server?](#why-do-i-need-a-local-server)
--------------------------------------------------------------

A local server provides the same environment as your web host’s server, allows you to install/run WordPress trunk on your computer, and is an essential tool in contributing to the development of WordPress core.

[What does AMP stand for?](#what-does-amp-stand-for)
----------------------------------------------------

Some local server programs have **AMP** in their name, which stands for **A**pache, **M**ySQL (or **M**ariaDB), and **P**HP. These are the same programs that are installed on your webhost’s server which allow you to run your WordPress site.

[Which local server should I install?](#which-local-server-should-i-install)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your choice of a local server program will primarily depend on which operating system you run on your computer. There are a couple that work on multiple operating systems, and all will give you a solid local development environment.

The [Advanced Administration handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/before-install/development/#installing-wordpress-on-your-computer) has a list of many popular options in the WordPress community.
